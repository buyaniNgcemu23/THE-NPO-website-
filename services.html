        Open Hands Foundation serves communities across South Africa. We focus on food relief, education support, skills training, and practical help.
      </p>
      <p class="services-text services-travel">
        We travel to different communities — Cape Town, Durban, Eastern Cape, and Gauteng — bringing support directly to the people who need it most.  
        Our teams run workshops, outreach events, and drives that make a real impact.
